PREVENTION OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: A CONTRIBUTION FROM MRI AND MACHINE LEARNING

This repository contains all the code created during my TFG at UPC in collaboration with Fundaci√≥ Pasqual Maragall. 

Our work supports that machine learning applied to longitudinal brain volumetric changes can be used to predict, with high precision, the presence of amyloid abnormalities in cognitively unimpaired subjects. Used as a triaging method to identify a fixed number of amyloid-positive individuals, this longitudinal voxel-wise classifier is expected to avoid 55% of unnecessary CSF and/or PET scans and reduce economic cost by 40%.
